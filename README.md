Oh yea just go and watch some videos or read https://www.w3schools.com/ . It's honestly that easy. You cannot tell me that you can't learn that by yourself. It's the most simple thing in the world of programming. ChatGPT can also help you.

## 3.1 Handle events
Look at this in depth and try to understand it. Use chatGpt and videos. Don't overdo it. "document.getEementById("anyButtonId").onclick = function(){console.log("Button clicked")}"
## 3.2 The cool way to code
- if(1 > 2){console.log("yes")}else{console.log("no")} can be replaced by console.log(1>2?"yes":"no") .
- if(xxx){yyy} can be replaced by xxx && yyy
- array.map((something, i), ()=>{console.log(`${i} = `+ something)}) make chatgpt explain this one. I'm lazy
Your boss likes this way of writing code more. You will too.
